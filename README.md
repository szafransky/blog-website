# blog-website
My custom blog webiste

The purpose of this project was to show my backend skills in node.js and express.js. Each page is the .ejs page. You can easily read and create new posts.
I've used MongoDB as database.
I've deployed my page on Heroku: https://stormy-meadow-80752.herokuapp.com/
